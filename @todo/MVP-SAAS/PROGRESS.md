# PROGRESS — MVP-SAAS

**Status:** Planning · 0 features started · 0 lines of product code

## Current Focus

Rebuild of the planning workspace is **complete**. All documentation deliverables (foundation,
ADRs, feature `PLAN.md`s, PRICING) are written; the workspace is navigable end-to-end without
the frozen old plan.

Next step: start the build — pick the first feature off the queue (`core-db`).

Blocker: none.

## Documentation progress (this rebuild)

- [x] `README.md` — entry point
- [x] `CONTEXT.md` — compiled knowledge
- [x] `FEATURES/README.md` — catalog + dependency graph + queue + derived F1–F4 view
- [x] `PROGRESS.md` *(this)*
- [x] `ARCHITECTURE.md` — concept + diagrams
- [x] `adr/` — surviving ADRs 001–018 (clean) + ADR 019 (confidence-gate) + `adr/README.md` index
- [x] `FEATURES/<slug>/PLAN.md` — all 21 active features + 8 ⚪ Future backlog (29 total)
- [x] `PRICING/` — **self-contained** (README · billing · models · plans · REVALIDATION · embeddings ·
  infrastructure) + live tooling in `research-app/` (Vite + lowdb OpenRouter/AA scanner)

## Decisions Made During Execution

- 2026-06-17: **Rebuilt from scratch** in `@todo/MVP-SAAS/` from the previous planning iteration.
  Recreate only what survives the new model.
- 2026-06-17: **Feature-graph is the primary structure**; F1–F4 phases demoted to a derived view.
- 2026-06-17: **Showcase-first** ordering → RAG quality (eval/confidence-gate/reranking) pulled
  forward to a first-class F1.5, no longer an F4 nice-to-have.
- 2026-06-17: **Polyglot kept**, with the explicit principle "Python where the ecosystem matters
  (parsing/OCR/eval), Node where it's the common path (API/chat/governance)". Recorded in ADR 001.
- 2026-06-17: **New feature `confidence-gate` + ADR 019** — retrieval-confidence short-circuit:
  a safe floor ("don't know" instead of hallucinate) and an optional ceiling (answer without LLM
  on near-exact matches). Did not exist in the old plan.
- 2026-06-17: ADRs carried over in **clean format** (survivors only), not as an evaluation diary.
- 2026-06-17: **PRICING is self-contained, not a link to the old doc.** The durable monetization
  logic (margin engine, billing modes, plan ladder, revalidation) lives in `MVP-SAAS/PRICING/` as
  ours; only volatile provider digits are deferred — handled by **live tooling**, not hand-copied
  tables. (Supersedes the earlier "lean summary referencing the frozen tables" leaning in §8.)
- 2026-06-17: **OpenRouter/AA scanner brought in** as `research-app/` (Vite + lowdb, "Scan" button
  fetches live OpenRouter prices × Artificial Analysis scores, curates tiers into `db.json`). It's our
  analysis tool; numbers in the `.md`s are a **2026-06-14 snapshot**, re-scan here to revalidate.
- 2026-06-19: **Absorbed from frozen SAAS-CHATBOT and made lean** — moved `research-app/`,
  `PRICING/embeddings.md`, `PRICING/infrastructure.md` into MVP-SAAS; dropped `market.md`, raw
  `infra.md`, and `BENCHMARK-PLAN.md` (obsolete/never-built tooling). Managed billing now documents
  **two candidates** (fixed-per-message + metered-per-token), decision deferred. SAAS-CHATBOT removed.
- 2026-06-17: **FUTURE backlog promoted to first-class features** — each of the 8 cards now has a
  `FEATURES/<slug>/PLAN.md` (`Layer: ⚪ Future`, `Status: backlog`), same format as the 21 active
  ones, promotable to a real layer freely. FEATURES/README ⚪ section is now a full catalog (29 total).
- 2026-06-17: **Consistency sweep + granularity review done** — ADR refs / `depends_on` / queue all
  consistent; 21 active features judged well-sized (no merges/splits). Minor note: `guardrails` sits
  in the 🟠 Revenue layer though it's conceptually governance — kept as-is (no Governance layer
  defined; the derived F3 view already treats it as governance).
